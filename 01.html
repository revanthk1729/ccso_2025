  <h3>Greenhouse Gases</h3>
  GHG- greenhouse gases, examples - CO2, N20,CH4, water vapour<br>

Earth recieves sunlight and heat every instant, some of that heat energy is reflected back at the stratosphere level. the remaining heat energy enters the earth atmosphere. some of that is reflected back by oceans and Greenhouse Gases trap remaining heat that is supposed to be reflected back from earth, increasing the heat holding by earth, increasing global temperatures.<br>

<h3>Climate and Weather description</h3>

Climate is the average daily weather for an extended period of time at a certain location. 
<br><br>
weather represents the situation at a particular time at a particular place, weather can be described by temperature, rainfall in mm, humidity, etc..
<br><br>
Climate change is a long-term changes in Earth’s climate patterns, broader than daily or seasonal weather changes. It includes large-scale effects such as melting ice caps, rising sea levels, shifting rainfall patterns, and increasing global temperatures.
<br><br>
Unlike weather, which is local and temporary, climate change spans decades and results from both natural processes and human activities.
<br><br>
Climate description include average weather, and any climate events that take place at a given place. when describing climate we use words like "generally...", "on average...", "most of the year...", "temperatures range between...", "rainfall is usually...". we use these to give a average idea of the climate, and additionally include any unusual events that happen such as unexpected rainfalls, droghts...
<br><br>
For example we can describe climate at thar desert as <br>
- Summers are extremely hot, with daytime temperatures often above 45°C, while nights can be cooler due to rapid heat loss.
<br><br>
- Winters are mild and dry.
<br><br>
- Rainfall is very low — averaging 100–500 mm per year, mostly during the monsoon season (July–September).
<br><br>
- Occasionally, like in 2010, there may be unusual rainfall, but that’s an exception, not the norm
<br>
<br>
<b>Quick analogy</b><br>
 - You look at Weather to decide what to wear today (based on hot/old/rainy today)
<br> - You look at Climate to decide what clothes to buy for your place (based on seasonal climate you buy clothes accordingly)<br>
<br>
Conclusion - Climate description is very general but detailed. Weather description is mostly giving numbers

IPCC -  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
<br><br>
IPCC is an international panel that releases assessment reports about climate changes gobally. They gather latest scientific research and observations to make such reports. These reports are made by contributions from scientists globally, and thoroughly verified and approved by all countries government members before releasing.<br><br>
These assessment reports guide international negotiations<br><br>
They help nations change or implement their climate policies<br><br>
They help public gain a correct understanding of current global climate situation
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
Climate change can be caused by <br>
1) natural causes - ex:-volcanic eruptions, ocean current shifting<br> 
2) man-made causes - ex:-bruning fossil fuels which raise GHG concentrations, deforestation, fertilizers which pollute soil
<br><br>
Before industrial revolution began in 1750, GHG emmisions were in control. 
<br><br>
GHG cycle - humans activities or natural activities do GHG emmisions, plants absord the co2 and other GHG in air through photosynthesis and they inturn decay underground into coaal, or other fossil fuels again. everything in cycle. 
<br><br>
Human activities since the starting of industrial revolution increase GHG emmisions and the plants or nature cant absorb back the increased GHG gases, so they remain in the atmosphere and trap heat
<br><br>
After industrial revolution and currently, it is believed world wide thar most of the GHG concentration comes from man made activities
<br><br>
<b>Question:</b> There were still small manageable amount of GHG emmisions before industrial revolution era by natural causes? name some such natural activities<br>
<b>Answer:</b> volcanic activity, oceans storing and releasing based on water current changes, forests, farming, solar variations
<br><br>
<b>Question:</b> what is Co2eq?
<br><b>Answer:</b> It is a relative unit used to represent GHG concentrations in the atmosphere of different gases relative to CO2 gas's impact. We can represent impact of different gases in terms of equivalent amount of CO2 concentration<br>

<h3>CONSEQUENCES OF TRAPPED HEAT BY GHGs</h3>
<br>
Disturbing natural cycles of everything. Snow formation and snow melting cycle is affected. More melting of ice, glaciers, but less reformation of snow because of delayed winters

Increased sealevel and floods. and heatwaves and droughts...

kyoto protocol participation of malaysia- legally binding participation to reduce GHG emissions

copenhagen accord - nonbinding political agreement, goal to reduce 2deg celcius increase in temp, commitments from developed to developing countries for money for mitigation

SREP- small renewable energy power

biomass - plants solar energy from photosynthesis in chemial form, which can be extracted into fuel or electricity or biogas
biogas - biomass when decomposed in the absence of oxygen . can be made into fuel through some chemical processes
