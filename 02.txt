IPCC - intergovernmental panel on climate change

humans and industrial revolution are the main reason for climate change.

issues with taking action on climate change is that, it is very expensive but many people dont realize yet that the outcome is priceless.

also it is hard because some countries are worried that they might invest more and the others get to enjoy that

energy production sectors account to the most amout of GHG emmisions 35%
agriculture and forests 25%
industry 21%, transport 14%

paris conference on climate change held in 2015, people agreed that we need to keep the global temp increase to below 2 degree celcius at the before 2100. it is the increase in avg global temp per year from industrial rev starting

looking at annual temperatures in india at different seasons. winters are getting too warm. increase of 2.95 deg celcius in 2017 winter. which is bad. avg is compensated to below 2 because the rest of the seasons is close to 1.5deg celcius

over the past 100 years. our increase in avg temp is 1.2 celcius. we havent reached 1.5 yet but we are experiencing the effects already.the intensity and frequency of extrene weather events are increased significantly. ex, droughts, floods...

strategies to prevent increasein GHG
reduce carbon emmisions, using energy available efficiently, because more emmisions come from energy production sector.

using more renewable energy resources

systematic changes are required in the whole range of economy

window for action starting is rapidly closing. if we only use 65%of our carbon emmisions credits. we will just touch the 2 deg celcius targets. so time to reduce
